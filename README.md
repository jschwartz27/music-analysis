# music-analysis

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

```conda activate midi```

Then run the following python script...

```python main.py```

so far this repo is all inspired by:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/wfaria/midi-music-data-extraction-using-music21

which has some other good stuff at the end as well, I would definitely recommend giving it a read!
